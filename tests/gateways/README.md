Test Layout
===========

You will need to symlink `ag_bin`, `rg_bin`, `ug_bin`, `ms_root`, `syndicate`, and `python` correctly for these tests to work.

If you checkout the Syndicate repositories in the same parent directory and build and install everything from source, then they should work as-is.
