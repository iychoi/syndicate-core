         Date when this gateway's certificate expires, in seconds
         since the epoch.
         
      driver=str:
         This is serialized JSON string that contains this gateway's 
         driver logic.  The contents are specific to the gateway 
         implementation. 
     
      private_key=str:
         This is a PEM-encoded private key for the gateway.  Pass "auto"
         to generate one automatically.

      caps=str|int:
         This is the capabilities string (or value) for this gateway.
         Capabilities are a bit-field of the following:
         
         GATEWAY_CAP_READ_DATA          Gateway can read data
         GATEWAY_CAP_WRITE_DATA         Gateway can write data
         GATEWAY_CAP_READ_METADATA      Gateway can read metadata
         GATEWAY_CAP_WRITE_METADATA     Gateway can write metadta
         GATEWAY_CAP_COORDINATE         Gateway can coordinate writes
         
         The volume owner sets a whitelist of allowed capabilities in
         create_gateway.  The user can only enable these white-listed 
         capabilities.  Only the volume owner can change the capability
         white-list.
         
   Returns:
      On success, this method returns True.
      Raises an exception on error.
   
   Authorization:
      An administrator can update any gateway.
      A volume owner can update any gateway in the volumes (s)he owns.
      A user cannot update the gateway.
      
   Remarks:
      Syndicate sends 'gateway_cert_b64' as a keyword argument that contains 
      the user-signed base64-encoded gateway certificate which contains all of the 
      keyword arguments.  Syndicate will merge the keyword arguments with the 
      gateway certificate stored locally.  If the gateway certificate is not 
      stored locally, it will try to use the cached copy on the MS.
      
      Syndicate may optionally send 'cert_bundle_b64' as a keyword argument as well,
      which will contain a serialized, volume owner-signed certificate bundle 
      for all gateways in the volume.  This will only be passed if the volume 
      owner is altering a gateway's capability whitelist.
      
      In addition, kw may contain 'driver_text'--the JSON-encoded driver for 
      the gateway--as well as 'cert_bundle_b64' (the new volume cert 
      bundle version vector, base64-encoded).
